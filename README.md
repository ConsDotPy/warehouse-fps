# Warehouse
Simple development of FPS. Getting practice on UE5.
## Follow Vector
We can use "Follow vector" Blueprint or linear transformation by "Vector rotation" blueprint. Vector rotation was used to aim projectiles, spawning them in front of us and avoid collision with our pawn.

## Main Result
This is the main development, it's the first version, more details will be added. After solving the aiming, i focused on giving the player max ammunition, which is displayed, after you run out of ammo, game restarts.
